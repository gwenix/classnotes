# classnotes

This repository isn't about code. It's about text files between friends so that we can send notes to each other via GIT in order to become more familiar with GIT.

To contribute to this, first clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/gwenix/classnotes.git

Then you can edit files as needed, once you've finished changing them, commit them with:

git commit [file] -m "Your message about what changed"

If you want to add new notes, use:

git add [file]

Then commit it as above.

Once you are done with changes, or just want to see your changes up on the site, use this:

git push -u origin master

Later, to get the latest version of the files, issue:

git pull

Basics of git!
