One of the best things about git is how flexible it is. It lets you track what you want, and forget the rest.
Your gitignore is a place where you list any files that you don't want git to track. These might be things
you only need locally, or stuff that is private and shouldn't get pushed up to github.

To add a gitignore I created a file labeled '.gitignore' (Dot important!), then ran 

touch accident.md

creating a fictitious file that we do not want in our commit. One of many ways of dealing with this is to
list the file in the gitignore - think of it like a manifest. It tracks everything that SHOULDN'T be tracked.
I edited gitignore to include one line:

accident.md

If you follow along these steps or pull down this repo with the gitignore inside, you could create a file called accident.md
and would see it greyed out in your code editor, telling you it won't get tracked.

This is one of the most useful tricks up your sleeve learning git! To be sure your gitignore stays up to date, be sure to run a

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Updating gitignore"
git push <branches as appropriate>

Happy Coding!
